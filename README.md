# The-Daily-Coffee
A static website for an imaginary coffee shop. This is part of study on learning web development.

# Chapter 1: The Brainstorm
With the power of the Google and Youtube, I was able to draw an idea on what type of static website I should build, a Coffee Shop Website. My goal for this website is to learn the basics of HTML and CSS.

Part of the learning is to know the:
- Basic Website Layout (Wireframe)
- Proper naming of classes in HTML
- Use of Flexbox and Grid
- Responsive website

# Chapter 2: The Technologies
As described in the Chapter 1, I created this website using HTML and vanilla CSS. I used Flexbox and the Grid system to align the items properly and used an API from https://fontawesome.com/ for the icons.

# Chapter 3: Mobile Device
The website is also designed to be fully responsive on smaller screens, using media queries in CSS.

# Chapter 4: Final Thoughts
Though I'm still a long way to go on becoming a Web Developer, this is the best stepping stone that I can give to myself to reach my goals in the future.
